## Fix (NieR) Automata Resolution - Pirate-Friendly Version

A patched version of the FAR; with auto-updates proxied, you can update without worry with builds from this git.

### FAQ
- Why no sources?

```
I don't rebuild the FAR, i have patched with the x64dbg/ida pro, so... i don't have the patched source.
```


- It's safe run a patched binary from the kaldaien?

```
I think yes, my patch start forcing the FAR trigger has pirate and analyze if he try something strange using the ProcMon
(If you aren't safe with my patch, you can test this tool, he log a big part of the actions from a process)
```



- No plans to start publish rebuild dll's?
```
Maybe, but for now, not necessary, and actually my visual studio is outdated, to recompile i need download this shit again and the
internet in the brazil is really, but really a bullshit
```

- The game close with Snake Sound (lol)
```
This isn´t a crash caused by the detection of the crack in the nier, Otherwise, this would have occurred to me, as I said earlier the first step before patching is to force the FAR to detect my copy as a pirate, to analyze anything suspicious (like corrupting the crack just like it was done in TOB)...
After this I force the nier's validation as always original, and play the game again for 5 ~ 10 minutes, change the graphics settings and bootup again with wrong clock date and offline, Yes, I am manic to the point of looking for triggers that expect the computer by an advanced date to activate, but stay calm, do not appear to have any, and kaildean is keeping the source updated.
All to have sure, my dll is safe to share.


Okay, and how to fix it?
- if you have the first version of the baldman crack, try disable the SSEOverlay.
- if you think this alert sound it´s because the detected crack, isn´t this, you can try a outated version from the FAR.
- MSI Nahimic and Razer (Insert Any Product Name Here) are known to interfere with Special K (dxgi.dll), you may need to disable that software to use the mod (official kaidlen note)
- Nothing Works?! Try the lastest version from the crack, my tests use the first version (SSE) and the second release + ali213 emulator.
- Nothing Again? You have any program that try hook/inject into the game? like the discord overlay? try disable anything like this.
- Nothing... So... I can lend my shoulders to you to cry if you need.
