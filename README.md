## Fix (NieR) Automata Resolution - Pirate-Friendly Version

A patched version of the FAR; with auto-updates proxied, you can update without worry with builds from this git.

### FAQ
- Why no sources?

```
I don't rebuild the FAR, i have patched with the x64dbg/ida pro, so... i don't have the patched source.
```


- It's safe run a patched binary from the kaldaien?

```
I think yes, my patch start forcing the FAR trigger has pirate and analyze if he try something strange using the ProcMon
(If you aren't safe with my patch, you can test this tool, he log a big part of the actions from a process)
```



- No plans to start publish rebuild dll's?
```
Maybe, but for now, not necessary, and actually my visual studio is outdated, to recompile i need download this shit again and the
internet in the brazil is really, but really a bullshit
```
